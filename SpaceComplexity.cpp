// Space Complexity - 
// The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function
// of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
//   this is a variable storing a value having a time complex of O(1)
  int a;
  int b=5;

//  an array storing a value of data having a time complexity of O(n)
  int n=100;
  int ar[n];
  
//  an 2D array having a time complexity of big O of O(n^2)
  int arr[n][n];
  
// if we add all the three than the time complexity will be 
//    O(1)+ O(n)+O(n^2)---->O(n^2)
